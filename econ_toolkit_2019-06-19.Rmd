# About Me

PhD candidate in Economics at The Ohio State University

**Use tools from applied econometrics** to study science and innovation

---

# Goals

Provide intuition for "methods" that economists have been using

Inspiration for ways you might apply this in the context you work in

---

# Caveats

Lots of advances in methodology have come from other fields including political science, epidemiology, statistics, computer science

Only one part of econometrics and economics

# Data scientists wear many hats

## Prediction vs causation


## $$y = X_1\beta_1 + \epsilon$$
---

$\hat{y}$ - If a student with a certain set of characteristics $X_i$ (e.g. test scores, demographics) arrives, what is my best guess of their future wages?

$\hat{\beta}$ - If I implement an educational intervention, what is my best guess of how much their wages will increase $\triangle \hat{y}$

# Design vs methods



---

## What can't quasi-experiments do

- Experiment you want vs experiment you get
- Local average treatment effects
- External validity

---

## Econometrics and Machine Learning

---

# Resources 

- Mostly Harmless Econometrics or Mastering 'Metrics
