# About Me
  
Finishing my PhD in Economics at The Ohio State University

Economics of science and innovation

R, dataviz, causal inference

--

Improv at [The Nest Theatre](https://nesttheatre.com/) on Broad St.

---

## What happens if you do X?

- Does employment decrease if you raise the minimum wage?

- Does investing in stem cell research actually lead to more research?

- Will running an advertising campaign raise revenue?

--

These are questions about **causation**

---

## Estimating causal effects is the bread and butter of many economists

Provide intuition for how economists and social scientists have approached this problem

Inspiration for ways you might apply this in other contexts

---

# Caveats

Lots of advances in methodology have come from other fields including political science, epidemiology, statistics, computer science

Only one part of econometrics and economics

---

class: inverse, middle

## Why is estimating causal effects hard?

---

## Eating chocolate wins Nobel Prizes?

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("img/chocolate_nobel.png")
```

---

## Prediction vs causation

## $$y = D\beta+ X\gamma + u$$

- $y$ is an outcome we care about (e.g. wages)
- $D$ is an indicator for a "treatment" (e.g. going to college)
- $X$ are some characteristics we observe ("observables")
- $u$ is stuff we don't observe ("unobservables")

--

### Why can't we just run a regression and call it a day?

---

## People don't make choices randomly

People who go to college are different than people who don't go to college 

- Different social networks
- Different aptitudes

--

### Many of these differences are *unobserveable* and could directly affect wages

---

## The effect of $U$ on $Y$ is wrongly attributed as the effect of D on Y

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("img/ovb.png")
```

---

## Usual Solution? Randomized Control Trials (RCTs)

- If we randomly assign the treatment, then the treatment and control groups have similar unobservables (on average)

---

## But RCTs are not always feasible

- Expense
- Internal resistance
- Ethics (randomly assign lead poisoning)

---

class: inverse, middle

## Quasi-experiments can be helpful here

---

## Quasi-experimental designs

- Instrumental variables
- Difference-in-differences 
- Synthetic control 
- Regression discontinuity


---

## Focus is on Research Design, less on methods

- Focuses discussion on credibility of research design

- Estimation is often done with linear regression

---

class: middle, inverse

## Instrumental variables

---

## Intuition

Problem: College attendance and wages are both related to unobserved characteristics

An *instrument* is something that affects college attendance but NOT wages

---

## What makes a good instrument?

1. Relevant: Has an effect on the intervention ( $Z$ affects $D$)

2. Exclusion restriction: Only related to the outcome through its effect on intervention ( $Z$ only affects $Y$ through $D$) 

---

## The exclusion restriction is untestable

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("img/iv_dag.png")
```

---

## Finding clever instruments is an entire industry...

- Gender of children as instrument for family size
- Quarter-of-birth for years spent in school
- Muslim holidays as for number of drivers on the road

---

## ...but *randomization* is a great instrument!  

- Oregon Medicaid Lottery

- If you have A/B tests, you have instruments!

---

## Do referrals increase retention?

- Problem: people who already refer more friends are probably more invested in the product

- Solution: find an A/B test that successfully increased referrals (e.g. an email campaign) and you have a ready-made instrument

---

class: inverse, middle

## Difference-in-differences

---

## Example

- Say you want to know how an increase in the Ohio state minimum wage changed employment
- If employment decreased after the minimum wage increased, does that mean the causal effect of the minimum wage was to decrease employment?

---

## Intuition

- Use a control group to account for underlying time trends 

- E.g. find a state that had similar trends in employment to Ohio before the minimum wage increase happened

---

## Similar trends, different levels

## Difference-in-differences relies on the parallel trend assumption

```{r}

dd_counterfac = df %>% 
  filter(treatment, time >= 0) %>% 
  mutate(Y = Y - 7)

ggplot(data = df, 
       aes(x = time, y = Y, 
           colour = treatment, 
           group = g
           )
       ) + 
  geom_smooth(data = dd_counterfac, 
              aes(x = time, y = Y), 
              colour = "grey", se = FALSE, method = "lm") + 
  geom_smooth(method = lm, se = FALSE) + 
  theme(legend.position = "none") + 
  scale_color_manual(values = c("#F05253", "#2A73CC", "#F05253", "#2A73CC"))

```

Classic example: Card and Krueger (1993)

- Compared employment in New Jersey and Pennsylvania before and after minimum wage was raised in New Jersey

---

## Synthetic Control is a close cousin of difference-in-differences

Used in comparative case studies - how did an event affect aggregate outcomes of a single unit (e.g. country, state)?

Example: What was the economic impact of reunification on West Germany?

---

## Synthetic control finds the weighted combination of countries that are most similar to Germany

- Minimize the distance between West Germany and potential control countries based on a set of pre-unification variables 

--- 

## West Germany looks different from the rest of the OECD

---

## West Germany and Synthetic West Germany look similar pre-reunification

---

## Synthetic Control: How can you measure the impact of TV advertising?

- Can't randomly assign TV ads to individual users
- Instead, randomly assign treatment to cities 

---

## Two issues with randomizing by geographic area

1. There are a limited number of cities and they are very different from each other
2. If you divide up the US into treatment and control, then you can't estimate the effect for *entire* US

---

## Create synthetic US for both treated *and* control cities

```
]

---

## Regression discontinuity

- Compare units just above or below an arbitrary/random cutoff 
- E.g. test scores to get a scholarship

---

```{r}

mu <- matrix(c(0, 0))
rho <- 0.5
sigma1 <- 0.5
sigma2 <- 2
Sigma <- matrix(c(sigma1 ^ 2, 
                  rho * sigma1 * sigma2, 
                  rho * sigma1 * sigma2, 
                  sigma2 ^ 2),
                c(2, 2))

simulatedXandC <- MASS::mvrnorm(n = n, mu = mu, Sigma = Sigma)


df <- tibble(X = simulatedXandC[, 1],
                 C = simulatedXandC[, 2],
                 tee = (simulatedXandC[, 1] > 0),
                 error = simulatedError)

df %<>%
    mutate(Y = 10 + X ^ 3 + 5 * tee + 1 * C + error)

ggplot(data = df, aes(x = X, y = Y, color = (X > 0))) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.8) +
  geom_smooth(method = lm,   
                se = FALSE) + 
  annotate(geom = "rect", 
           xmin = -0.1, xmax = 0.1, ymax = 15, ymin = 10, 
           fill = NA, colour = "black")

```

## Regression discontinuity doesn't work if units around threshold are not randomly assigned

- There could be manipulation around the threshold e.g. influential parents lobby to get their children extra points if they're just below the threshold

---

## Validity Checks

1. Look at distribution of units around the threshold

2. Look at distribution of observables around the threshold

---

## #Units above threshold $\approx$ #Units below threshold

```{r}

df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = X)) + 
  geom_histogram(breaks = seq(-2, 2, 0.5), colour="white", fill = "#00B39F") + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, linetype = 2, size = 1.3) + 
  labs(title = "No manipulation") 



```

---

```{r}
df %>%
  mutate(rand = runif(n()),
         X = ifelse(rand < 0.33 & X < 0, -X, X)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = X)) + 
  geom_histogram(breaks = seq(-2, 2, 0.5), colour="white", fill = "#00B39F") + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, linetype = 2, size = 1.3) + 
  labs(title = "Manipulation - Unusual jump at threshold")

```

## What can't quasi-experiments do

- Experiment you want vs experiment you get
- Local average treatment effects
- External validity
