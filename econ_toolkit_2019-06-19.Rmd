# About Me

PhD candidate in Economics at The Ohio State University

**Use tools from applied econometrics** to study science and innovation

---

# Goals

Provide intuition for "methods" that economists have been using

Inspiration for ways you might apply this in the context you work in

---

# Caveats

Lots of advances in methodology have come from other fields including political science, epidemiology, statistics, computer science

Only one part of econometrics and economics

## Prediction vs causation


## $$y = X_1\beta_1 + \epsilon$$
---

$\hat{y}$ - If a student with a certain set of characteristics $X_i$ (e.g. test scores, demographics) arrives, what is my best guess of their future wages?

$\hat{\beta}$ - If I implement an educational intervention, what is my best guess of how much their wages will increase?

--

Estimating $\hat{\beta}$ is the bread and butter of many applied economists 

---

Why can't we just run a regression of $y$ on $X$?

---

## People don't make choices randomly

E.g. people don't randomly choose whether to go to college 

---

## Threats to validity

Omitted variable bias - people make choices to 

Reverse causation - Umbrellas cause rain


---

## Randomized experiments are often treated as the gold standard

---

## But RCTs are not always feasible

- Feasibility or expense
- Ethics

---

Which is where quasi-experiments come in

---

## Quasi-experimental designs

- Instrumental variables
- Difference-in-differences
  + Synthetic control
- Matching
- Regression discontinuity


---

# Design vs methods

- Focus is on *credible* design
- Advantages: assumptions are transparent, focuses the discussion

---

## Instrumental variables

- Can address confounding and reverse causality

---

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("img/iv_dag.png")
```

---

## What makes a good instrument?

- Relevant 
- Has an effect on the intervention

- Exclusion restriction
- Only related to the outcome through its effect on intervention

---

## Where to find instruments

- Gender of children as instrument for family size
- Quarter-of-birth for years spent in school
- Muslim holidays as instrument for number of drivers on the road
- **Randomization** is a great instrument - e.g. Oregon medicaid lottery

---

## A/B tests can be instruments too!
  

---

### If you run A/B tests you have instruments too!

---

## What can't quasi-experiments do

- Experiment you want vs experiment you get
- Local average treatment effects
- External validity

---

## Econometrics and Machine Learning
